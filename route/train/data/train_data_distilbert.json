Results of laboratory studies, including complete blood count, serum electrolyte concentrations, and liver function tests, were within the reference ranges. The patient otherwise had been healthy and had never been told that he had elevated blood pressure. He takes no medications. A follow-up visit in the office 2 weeks ago disclosed elevated urinary normetanephrine and metanephrine and plasma aldosterone concentrations. The patient was referred to a surgeon, who recommended the adrenalectomy. Today, vital signs are temperature 36.6\u00b0C (97.9\u00b0F), pulse 100/min, respirations 14/min, and blood pressure 170/95 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses no significant findings.

If you're really busy because of work, chores, or errands, see if you can delegate some of those tasks to someone else, like a family member or coworker. Also, try to limit your use of electronics since watching TV and scrolling on your phone can take up a lot of your spare time. Instead, schedule an hour or more every evening to focus on doing things you enjoy, like your hobbies.",

Next, hold a balloon loosely by the neck, fit a funnel or plastic straw into it, and pour 2 tablespoons of baking soda through it into the balloon. Then, stretch the neck of the balloon over the top of the bottle before lifting the balloon up over the bottle. The baking soda will fall out of the balloon, through the neck of the bottle, and into the vinegar. The 2 ingredients will fizz and react to create carbon dioxide, which will then inflate your balloon!",

        "answer": "To make a cardboard igloo for your cat, start by cutting out 6 cardboard circles that gradually increase in size. Make sure the biggest circle is large enough for your cat to curl up on, since that will be the floor inside the igloo. Then, cut out 33 more cardboard circles, making the first 10 gradually increase in size and the other 23 gradually decrease in size. With these circles, you'll also need to cut out the inner diameter so when you stack them there's a space inside the igloo for your cat. Additionally, you'll need to cut out an opening on one side of each of the first 21 circles you cut out, which will end up being the entrance to the igloo. After you cut out those 33 circles, cut out 5 more that gradually decrease in size. You don't need to cut out the interior diameter for these. Finish your igloo by stacking and gluing all of the circles together, starting with the first 6 circles you cut out for the floor.",

Most toilet seats are the same size, but it's better to check just in case! Once you've bought a new seat that fits, use a flathead screwdriver to pry off the caps on the bolts that attach the old seat to the bowl. If there aren't any caps, you can skip this step. Next, use an adjustable wrench to loosen and remove the nut on each bolt so you can lift the old seat off. When the old seat is off, hold the new seat over the toilet bowl, and drop the bolts into the empty holes where the old bolts were. Finish by threading the nuts onto the bolts to tighten the new seat into place.",

Next, fill the tank with equal parts water and either lemon juice or vinegar and place a container under the coffee outlet. Then, press any blinking coffee button to run the water through the machine and expel it into the container. Pour the water from the container back into the tank to descale again. Once done, rinse all of the parts in water before you go through the descaling process twice more, but this time with clean water instead of solution.",

        "answer": "The easiest way to roast corn is to trim off the silky tassels and place the corn directly onto your oven rack with the husk still on. If you want the kernels to get soft and juicy, remove the husk and wrap the corn in foil before placing it on a baking sheet. You can also place the shucked corn onto a foil-lined baking sheet for a crisp brown finish. No matter which approach you use, roast the corn in the oven on the center rack at 400 \u00b0F for 25-30 minutes.",

Cut the apples into 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) pieces and spread them out in an 8 inch (20 cm) baking dish. Next, combine 2/3 cups (80 grams) of flour, 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar, 1/2 cup (100 grams) of brown sugar, and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon in a large mixing bowl. Cut 6 tablespoons of chilled unsalted butter into the mixture with a fork or a pastry cutter. Cutting in simply means combining the butter with the flour until it reaches a crumbly sandy texture. Be careful not to overwork the butter or it will become too soft and more difficult to work with. Pour the crumble topping over the apples and bake it for 45 minutes or until golden.

        "question": "What\u2019s the best way to remove dog waste from a backyard?",
        "answer": "To remove dog waste from your backyard, try gathering it up every day in a plastic bag. Place your hand inside the bag like a glove, put the bag over the poo, and pull the bag down over it so you don't have to touch it directly. Alternatively, you can use a pooper scooper, which you can buy online or from a pet store. This is a shovel-like device that picks up the poo for you so you can dispose of it. Another option is to apply freeze spray to the poo, which will make it easier to remove later. To use the spray, hold the can a few inches from the poo, spray it for 2 or 3 seconds, and wait for it to harden. Whichever method you decide to use, make sure you dispose of the poo in a trash can, since dog waste can be harmful to humans if it's left lying around.",

Then, strain 14 cups of juice to get rid of any seeds before adding the juice to a pot with sugar. Heat the pot until it's almost boiling, then add acid blend and yeast nutrient. Next, transfer the juice to a fermentation container and wait 24 hours before adding champagne yeast. After another day, rack the wine, then leave it for 3 months. Finally, rack the wine again, leave it for 2 months, rack it for a third time, and leave it  for another month.",

To do so, remove the nuts and washers from your old pads and pull the pads free from the calipers, which squeeze the pads to the tires to make the bike stop. Then, put the new pads in, align them with the tires, and replace the nuts and washers. If you need to adjust your brake\u2019s calipers, tighten the spring on the side that\u2019s moving too much by bending it with pliers.

Your Flash Pass will come in the form of a Q-Bot, which is a small beeper that lets you reserve rides. Check online to see which rides your Flash Pass works for, although it usually covers all the major rides in the park. To make reservations, scan your Q-Bot on the scanning station in front of each ride, or do it directly from your Q-Bot. When your Q-Bot vibrates to notify you of your reservation, head to the Flash Pass entrance for the ride you booked. At the end of the day, make sure you return your Q-Bot so you don\u2019t get charged a fee.",

While it\u2019s best to plant a Frangipani in the ground if you live somewhere with harsh winters, plant it in a pot so you can move it indoors seasonally. Frangipanis need to be planted somewhere that gets at least 6 hours of sunlight a day. They also need fresh soil mixed with a high phosphorus fertilizer to thrive. Once you plant your Frangipani, water it thoroughly then give it some mulch or moss to help it retain moisture. As it grows, you\u2019ll want to give it an inch of water a week, since these plants prefer dryer conditions.",

When you're ready to get started, cut away all of the old caulk on your tub using a putty knife and clean the tub with a commercial cleaner. Then, tape off the edges of the tub and cover anything you don't want to refinish with plastic. Finally, apply 3 coats of the reglazer or finish to your bathtub, letting it dry for 15 minutes in between each coat. When you're finished, let the tub dry for at least 24 hours before using it again.",

After pushing the excess air out of the bag, seal it and place it in the fridge for 4 to 12 hours, depending on how strong you want the flavors to be. To ensure the marinade coats each side evenly, turn the bag every 2 hours, or halfway through your marinating time.",

        "answer": "To make pavlova, start by combining corn starch and sugar, then beat it into 4 egg whites 1 teaspoon at a time. When the mixture develops stiff peaks, mix in the vinegar and vanilla. Pour the mixture into a round tray covered with parchment paper and make an indent in the middle for the topping to sit in later, then bake the meringue at 270 degrees F for 60-70 minutes. Allow the pavlova to cool on a wire rack before spreading the whipped cream on top. Finish by topping your pavlova with strawberries or kiwi slices.",

When both ends are securely in place, assemble and attach the nose to one of the circles. Draw a pig's face above the nose using any color you like and glue the ears to the sides. Finally, use a box cutter to cut a hole in the top of your piggy bank that's just large enough for coins to fit through. ",

Although you should never keep it in direct sunlight, make sure you place or hang your prayer plant near a window so it gets indirect sunlight. You should also add lukewarm water to the pot whenever its soil starts to get dry so it won\u2019t dry out. In addition to water, feed your prayer plant with a water-soluble fertilizer diluted to half-strength every 2 weeks, which will give it all the nutrients it needs. If you want your plant to grow quicker, use sharp scissors or hand pruners to snip a few inches from some of the stems 2 or 3 times a year, since new stems and leaves will grow from the cuts.",

Place a few dots of foundation on your face, then blend it in with a brush or makeup sponge to even out your skin tone. If you want to emphasize your eyebrows, lightly fill them in with a brow pencil or powder that matches your natural hair color. You can also brush a natural-colored eyeshadow, like soft peach or beige, over your eyelids for an everyday look. Use a brown or black eyeliner pencil to draw a thin line on your top lid to draw attention to your eyes. If you want thicker, darker lashes, apply a little brown or black mascara to your top and bottom lashes. To bring out the color in your lips, apply some lip gloss or lipstick.",

        "answer": "Before artificially inseminating your dog, take it to your vet to make sure it\u2019s in good health. If so, the vet will collect the semen and examine it to make sure the sperm cells look normal. If you don't plan on using the semen right away, ask your vet to chill or freeze it. Once the female dog is ready, the vet will use a pipette to insert the semen in to the uterus.",

Alternatively, wrap quilt batting around cushions that have pillow-like stuffing to give them more body. Finally, zip your cushions back up or sew them back together, then put them back on your sofa.",

You\u2019ll need at least a dozen wine and spirits bottles to make your bottle tree, but you can add bottles to the tree over time. You\u2019ll also need a small dead tree, a premade bottle tree frame, or a frame you made yourself. All you need to do is remove the labels from the bottles, then slide them onto the branches so they're upside down. If you have a lot of bottles and the tree starts to waver, cement the tree into place or weigh down its base so it doesn\u2019t blow over in a strong wind.",

        "answer": "You may find it hard to feel like eating breakfast first thing in the morning, but there are things you can do to help! Try to avoid eating anything for about 2-3 hours before you go to bed each night so you\u2019ll be more hungry when you wake up. Set your alarm a little earlier than normal to give yourself plenty of time to eat, and do about 30 minutes of light exercise, like push-ups or sit-ups, to work up an appetite. Over time, this should help your body get used to eating in the mornings.",

        "question": "What steps can I take to ensure feeding is comfortable for dogs with arthritis?",
        "answer": "Even everyday activities like eating can be difficult for arthritic dogs, but you can make this a bit easier by raising your dog\u2019s food bowl slightly off the ground on a small coffee table or cardboard box. While this makes it easier for your dog to eat, a raised bowl has a slightly higher risk of bloat, so watch for whining or excessive scratching after eating and give your dog 90 minutes to rest after eating before giving it exercise. If you feed your dog in the kitchen or another place with slippery floors, put down runners or rugs where your dog eats to lower its risk of it falling down. You might want to also consider moving your dog\u2019s dish to a carpeted room, although this can get messy if your pup is a sloppy eater.",

For oven-cooked chorizo, set your broiler on high and give it 5-10 minutes to heat up. When the broiler is ready, you can put the chorizo on a broiler pan and broil it for 11-12 minutes, turning it every 4 minutes so it cooks evenly.",

        "question": "What steps can I follow to eliminate fleas using Dawn dish soap?",
        "answer": "If your pet has fleas, a Dawn dishsoap bath is a gentle remedy that can help get rid of them. Fill a bathtub or basin with lukewarm water that\u2019s only about as deep as your pet\u2019s belly, then put your pet in the water. Use your hands to wet your pet\u2019s fur through to the skin, but be careful to avoid its eyes and ears. Next, use a little dish soap to lather up your pet\u2019s fur. For most dogs and cats, 2 or 3 tablespoons of soap are a good starting point, but you can use more for a larger pet or a severe flea infestation. Work the soap into its fur with your fingers or a brush and make sure it gets all the way down to the skin. Let the dish soap sit for about 5 minutes, then rinse your pet thoroughly with clean water and rub it dry with a towel. If you still notice fleas on your pet after the bath, repeat the process.",

Use garden shears to prune long shoots so there are only 3-5 buds per shoot, and aim to cut away about half of the previous year\u2019s growth. However, avoid cutting the woody frame of the plant. In the early spring, around April, add phosphate fertilizer to the ground around the tree, then add compost to the soil, topped by a 2-inch layer of mulch.",

Hold the case still with your nondominant hand and use your other index finger or thumb to press down on the outer rim of the metal tip until it's securely in place. This will be the bowl of the pipe. You can add a cigarette filter at the opening on the other end if you prefer a less harsh smoke. Otherwise, this pipe is ready to go!",

To use an at-home mixture, start by pouring a pot of boiling water down the drain, and then pour \u00bd cup of baking soda down the drain. Let the baking soda sit for 5 minutes, and then pour 1 cup of vinegar and 1 cup of hot water down the drain.

        "answer": "To get rid of silverfish, vacuum your home thoroughly to remove eggs that might be hiding in carpets, floorboards, and hard-to-reach corners and crevices. For an easy, non-toxic way to kill silverfish, sprinkle some diatomaceous earth in places where you\u2019ve seen them, like under the sink, in the basement, and in the back of cabinets. Diatomaceous earth is a powder that will dry out and kill silverfish when they come into contact with it. Though it is non-toxic, make sure to keep it away from children and pets. Place commercial silverfish traps throughout your home to catch even more silverfish. To prevent silverfish from entering your home, seal up any cracks around doors and windows with caulk. Use a dehumidifier if your home is humid since silverfish thrive in wet environments. You should also keep dry foods like pasta, rice, and cereal in sealed containers to cut off their food source. Finally, remove any stacks of papers, books, or magazines around your home since silverfish like to hide in them.",

Spray your roses with water in the morning to rinse the aphids off as well as give your plant time to dry in the sun to avoid fungus. When watering, make sure to get the underside of the leaves too since aphids tend to hang out there to stay out of the sun. Repeat this process daily for 1 to 2 weeks.

        "answer": "Building a Japanese garden can be a great way to create a space to relax in your yard. If you want to create a zen garden, you\u2019ll need to flatten out a square piece of land and surround the area with rocks. Then, cover the square with sand and gravel. You can add a few simple plants, like moss and small trees. Rake through your sand or gravel surface to create grooves that look like water, which creates a relaxing feel. Alternatively, try building a tea garden, which is used for performing tea ceremonies. Tea gardens are divided by a wall of rocks or a small gate into 2 areas, known as the inner and outer garden. The outer area of your garden should have a pathway to your inner garden, and contain a few shrubs and plants. You should also place a water basin between the 2 gardens, which visitors use to cleanse themselves before entering the inner garden. In your inner garden, you\u2019ll want to build a tea house and have natural plants, such as ferns, mosses, and shrubs.",

If this is the case, use scissors to cut the label off instead. If the label isn\u2019t attached to the seam holding the garment together, then push the tip of the seam ripper underneath one of the top stitches. Next, gently pull the seam ripper to loosen and remove the stitch, before continuing the process along the whole seam until the label is free.",

Place a boneless duck skin-side down on top of the stuffing-covered turkey, then cover it with stuffing as well, and repeat with the chicken.

        "answer": "An easy way to make sopapillas is to use ready-made flour tortillas, which can be found at most grocery stores. To begin, fill a pan with with enough oil for the tortillas to be fully immersed, and heat the oil to 400\u00b0F. While the oil heats, cut the tortillas into triangles. Once the oil is hot, drop the triangles into the oil and wait for each side to turn a golden brown color before flipping. Finally, remove the sopapillas from the oil, set them on a paper towel to soak the excess oil, and serve with your favorite toppings, like cinnamon and sugar.",

If the plants look tall and thin, place a fluorescent lamp above them so they can get more light and grow bushier. Once the plants are 5-6 inches tall, transplant them outdoors to a sunny area and leave at least 18 inches between plants. When you\u2019re ready to harvest your catnip, trim off stalks and dry them on a paper towel next to a sunny window for 2 days.",

        "answer": "Spider mites can infest and damage your outdoor tomato plants, but you can keep them away with a few simple tricks. Tomato plants need at least 7 hours of sunlight every day, but keeping them out of the afternoon sun will help keep spider mites away. If your plants are in pots, move them into the morning sun but out of the afternoon sun, or plant your tomatoes in a spot where they\u2019ll mainly get the less drying morning heat. Another way to deter spider mites is to place hot pepper or garlic in the soil. Spray the soil under the plants with a mixture of cayenne pepper flakes and water or mashed garlic cloves and water. When watering your plants, soak the soil around them every 7 to 10 days. When hosing down the soil, spray the undersides of the leaves too to remove any mites that may have started to infest the area.",

        "answer": "To boil lobsters, fill a 6-gallon stock pot with 4-5 gallons of water. Add 12 tbsp of salt for each gallon of water, along with thyme, bay leaves, and the juice from a lemon, and bring the water to a boil. Once the water is boiling, use tongs to grasp your live lobsters by the tail and gently dip them into the water one at a time. When the lobsters are in the water, clamp the lid onto the pot tightly and let them boil 8 minutes for each 1 pound of lobster. Stir the lobsters about halfway through the cooking time. The lobsters are ready when the shell is bright red and the meat inside is opaque and white.",

        "answer": "To set up a fish tank for goldfish, choose an aquarium that holds at least 20 gallons. Use smooth gravel as your substrate, and decorate the tank with plants, rocks, and other decor. Goldfish produce a lot of waste, so include a filtration system in your tank. Fill the aquarium with water that\u2019s been treated with a conditioner to remove chlorine and chloramine, and let the water sit for about 2 weeks before you add the goldfish so it can build up beneficial bacteria.",

Next, put your wooden or metal form blocks in the vice and clamp your sheet of metal between the forms. If your sheet metal is long, ask a friend to stabilize the part hanging out from the form blocks so it doesn't affect the bend. Then, tap your metal along the bend line with a rubber or plastic mallet until the sheet bends to the angle you want. If you're working with a thick sheet of metal, apply heat from a blowtorch along the bend line to soften it.",

The next day, peel and cut a white onion into quarters, then stud each quarter with one clove. Next, pour 4 cups (1 liter) of milk into a saucepan, and add the quartered onion along with 2 bay leaves. Add 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of white peppercorn, 2 mace blades, and 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of table salt, and bring the mixture to a near boil over medium heat. Remove the saucepan from the heat, cover it, and let the ingredients infuse for 1 to 2 hours. While you're waiting, break up the bread slices into small cubes, about the size of a crouton. Once the milk mixture is ready, heat it over low heat, and add the bread cubes. The bread will absorb the sauce and thicken it. Cook the sauce for 15 minutes. Just before serving, mix in 2 tablespoons (30 grams) of butter. Add a splash more milk or cream and sprinkle in some nutmeg if you would like. Pour the sauce into a gravy boat or bowl, and enjoy!",

Next, prime the floor so the paint will adhere better. Once the primer is dry, prepare to apply your paint. You can choose a latex acrylic, which will last about 2 years, or an epoxy, which can last 4 years. Then, pick a corner to start and work strip by strip from one end of the garage to the other.

        "answer": "To make bread and butter pudding, first preheat your oven to 180\u00b0C (355\u00b0F), and grease a baking dish with softened butter. Then, cut 8 slices of bread in half diagonally, and cut each half in half again. Spread softened butter onto one side of each piece. Place 8 of the pieces into the baking dish with the buttered sides facing up. Next, sprinkle a handful of sultanas or raisins over the bread, followed by a liberal amount of cinnamon. This completes the first layer. Repeat the process to add more layers until you run out of pieces of bread, then set aside. To make the custard, first add 1 1/2 cups (350 mL) each of whole milk and double cream to a small saucepan. Place the saucepan on the stove and heat on low until it starts to steam. While that's heating up, crack 2 eggs into a bowl, and add 2 tablespoons (25 grams) of granulated sugar. Whisk the eggs and sugar until fully blended. Finish the custard by slowly pouring the milk and cream mixture into the egg and sugar mixture, then whisking everything together. Put a strainer inside of another bowl, and pour the custard into it to catch any bits of cooked egg which you can discard. Now, pour the custard evenly over the bread in the baking dish. Sprinkle some nutmeg, cinnamon, and  a bit more sugar over the top of the bread and custard. Let the bread sit for 30 minutes to soak up the custard, then bake it in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes. You'll know it's done when the bread pudding has a golden brown color and the custard has thickened.",

Then, if your room is longer than your molding and you had to make scarf cuts to join 2 pieces, put a thin layer of glue on the cut of the first piece, fit the joint snugly, and fasten the second piece with nails, wiping away any glue. Keep going around the room in one direction until you\u2019re done.",

To begin, lower your hedgehog face up into the water. Keep a gentle but firm hold on your hedgehog until it settles and you can put it down. Then, fill a cup with water and pour it over your hedgehog\u2019s body, but be careful to avoid its face, ears, and eyes. Dampen the toothbrush, then clean its quills gently in the direction of growth starting at the front of its body. Then rinse it in clean water.",

        "answer": "If you want to make a colored fire, wait until your campfire has burnt down until there's a layer of embers under it, then sprinkle your chosen chemical into the fire to change the flames' color. Choose copper chloride if you want to create blue flames or lithium chloride for pink flames. Alternatively, melt paraffin wax before adding 2 tablespoons of your chosen chemical to it. Next, pour the mixture into paper cupcake wrappers. Once the cakes have set, remove one from the paper and throw it into a burning fire.",

This will tell your horse to open its mouth, but make sure to keep your fingers away from its tooth to avoid getting bitten. Once your horse\u2019s mouth is open, guide the bit between its teeth. As you move the bit to the back of the mouth, pull the crown of the bridle up over your horse\u2019s head. Next, gently move your horse\u2019s ears out of the way as you pull the crown over them. All that\u2019s left is to fasten the buckles around the neck and the chin. You\u2019ll want to be able to fit 4 fingers underneath the neck buckle and 2 fingers under the neck buckle.",

Then, measure the dimensions of your sofa and draw them onto the material using chalk. Next, take a pair of scissors and cut out the pieces of your cover, including any patterns. Once you've cut the pieces out, pin them together in the shape you want the cover to be sewn in. Sew the side sections to the arms of the sofa before sewing the back and seating area together.

Then, use a credit card or library card to carefully scrape off the decal. To do this, hold the blade parallel to your window so you don't scratch the glass and slowly slide the blade under one corner. Once you have a corner done, use the card to chip away at any remaining residue. If there is still residue after the decal has been removed, use glass cleaner to remove it.",

A bedroom or spare room will work best, as you want a room that gets little light and is at least 68 degrees Fahrenheit. After a week or two, take the dried mint down and strip the leaves from the stems. To dry your mint in the microwave, spread the leaves out onto a microwave-safe plate and cook them in 10-second intervals. Take the leaves out once they get crispy and start to curl, which should take between 15 to 45 seconds. If you want to use a traditional oven, bring the oven to 140 degrees Fahrenheit, then turn it off. Then, spread your mint leaves on a baking sheet and let them sit in the warm oven for 5 to 20 minutes.",

        "answer": "To make a basic loom bands bracelet, start by twisting 1 band into an \u201c8\u201d and folding it in half to make a circle, which you can slide into a C-clip to start your bracelet. Then, slide a new band halfway through the circle and pull the ends together to form a loop. While you\u2019re holding the loop, slide a new band through it. The previous band will become a link in the bracelet and this new band will become the band you pull into a loop to create the next link. Continue adding bands in this way until your bracelet is long enough, then slide the remaining loop into the C-clip to finish your bracelet.",
