        "question": "What is the correct way to cite a poem in APA style?",
        "answer": "If you want to cite a poem using the APA style, include your quote from a poem in quotation marks if it's less than 40 words, and use forward slashes to indicate line breaks. To cite a longer passage, begin the quote on a new line and indent it to create a block quotation. For your in-text citation, include the author's name, year of publication, and page number, preceded by the letter \"p.\" When it comes to the title, capitalize all major words, place short titles in quotes, and italicize longer titles.",

Once the egg is submerged, the chemical reaction between the acetic acid in the liquid and the calcium carbonate in the eggshell will cause the shell to dissolve. For the best results, cover the glass with some plastic wrap or foil, then place it on a shelf in your refrigerator for 24 hours. After a day has passed, carefully replace the vinegar in the glass with fresh vinegar and return the egg to the fridge for another 24 hours. Finally, remove the egg from the fridge to see if the shell is dissolved, and put it back for one more day if it isn't.",

Once the chair is dry, put it on a drop-cloth, apply a spray primer, and allow it to dry. Then, apply several light coats of your chosen spray paint.

Then, crease the fold, open the paper, and fold in the opposite direction along the same crease. Finally, unfold your paper and cut along the straight, creased line with scissors. You can also use a craft knife to cut through the crease if you don't have scissors on hand.",

If your dress has a skirt, you'll need to sew the bottom of the lining around the hemline.",

Then, you'll need to turn the material inside out, fold the cut edge back 1 inch, and sew it together. Make sure you leave a \u00bd inch gap at the back for the elastic. Once you\u2019ve sewn the hem, you\u2019ll want to cut the strip of elastic to fit around your chest, then feed it through the hem and sew it together in the gap you left.",

        "answer": "To make movie theater popcorn, start by melting 2 sticks of butter in the microwave. Then, let the butter sit until it separates into 3 distinct layers, which should only take a few minutes. Next, skim the foam off the top of the butter with a spoon, and pour the middle layer of butter into a separate container, throwing out the solids at the bottom. Finally, drizzle the clarified butter over some popcorn to give it a classic movie-theater flavor.",

If you're using a spoon for a dry ingredient, make sure you level off the ingredient by scraping a knife across the spoon. To use measuring cups, use dry cups for dry ingredients and wet cups for wet ingredients. For most dry ingredients, you should scrape a knife over the top of the cup to level off the ingredient inside. If a recipe calls for a packed cup, press the ingredients down in the cup with the back of a spoon.",

Then, cut a cotton swab to your desired length, and use a pin to poke a hole in the center of a foam marshmallow. Once you\u2019ve prepared the marshmallow, stick one end of the swab into the hole and the other end into the wooden bead. Finish the lamp by cutting a piece of cardstock for the lampshade, and gluing it in place so it covers the foam. If you want to add a miniature bed, cut out a bed frame from cardboard using an online pattern, and glue it together. Next, wrap some foam around a piece of cardboard to make a mattress, and place it inside the frame. Finally, paint your  bed.",

For example, if the leak is coming from the wheel, you may have to remove the wheel and check the lines and calipers. To fix a leaky caliper, purchase a caliper rebuild kit from an automotive store or dealership and remove your car\u2019s brake bleeder. Then, disconnect the steel and rubber brake lines and replace them as well if they look cracked or worn out. Strip everything from the calipers so you can blow low-pressure compressed air into them to pop the piston out. From there, replace the piston and put the caliper back together.

Finally, add chicken or beef broth and 2 sliced onions to the skillet and simmer everything for 15-20 minutes.",

Next, give the furniture a new coat of paint, use coarse-grit sandpaper or a sanding block to achieve an uneven, weathered look, and apply the top coat of paint. If you want a more distressed look, add cracks, holes, and scratches to the surface and replace the current hardware with antique or weathered pieces.",

If the paint is thick or the wood is polished, use a scraper to scrape off the paint. Alternatively, apply a chemical stripper to the object using a paint brush, leave it to soften the paint for 30 minutes, and scrape off the paint with a spatula. To finish, sand the item with sandpaper. If you want you're item to have a new finish, try giving it a coat of clear timber varnish.",

Then, coat your vegetable lightly with oil and place them on the grill. If the vegetables are small enough to fall through the grate, place them in a grilling basket, or wrap them in tin foil with the top left open.",

        "answer": "To make a basic cucumber sandwich, start by peeling the skin away from the cucumber and cutting it into thin, crisp slices. Next, let the cucumber drain in a colander for 10 minutes so your sandwich won't up soggy. Then, combine the cream cheese, Worcestershire sauce, mayonnaise, garlic powder, and onion salt. Finally, spread the cream cheese mixture on 2 pieces of bread and sandwich a few slices of cucumber in between them.",

First, pour 3 parts Mod Podge and 1 part water into a measuring cup. Add the food coloring you want until you get a deep color. Make sure to mix everything well so the food coloring is totally absorbed into the solution. Pour a small amount into your jar or bottle, then swirl it around so it covers the sides. Then, pour out the excess solution and allow your jar to set for 1 hour. Once it\u2019s set, bake your bottle or jar at the lowest temperature for 20 minutes.",

Then, apply a commercial stain remover to the stains. Machine wash your garment using warm water, and the stains should be gone! For acrylic paint stains that are already dry, start by dabbing the stains with some rubbing alcohol and a cloth until you see some of the color transfer to the cloth. You can also use nail polish remover, hairspray, or another alcohol-based product. Finally, apply a stain remover, and machine wash your garment with warm water. Remember not to dry your clothing until the acrylic paint is completely gone since it could cause the stains to set. If your stain has already set, read on for ways to remove acrylic paint with hairspray, vinegar, or isopropyl alcohol!",

Once you\u2019ve finished cleaning your slippers, wear them for half an hour or until they\u2019re dry so they can mold to your feet. Canvas shoes are easier to clean. All you need to do is put them in a lingerie bag and wash them in the washing machine. Leave them to air dry away from direct sunlight. Don\u2019t dry them in the dryer since this can shrink them.",

        "answer": "Cheesecake develops cracks when the batter has too many air bubbles or when it shrinks after baking. To prevent these cracks, mix the batter lightly and don\u2019t overmix since mixing too much will cause air bubbles to form. You can also try adding a tablespoon of cornstarch or flour to the batter since this will prevent it from shrinking after baking. Before you add the batter to the pan, make sure to grease the pan thoroughly with a cooking spray, butter, or shortening. This will prevent the cheesecake from pulling away from the pan and cracking as it cools. When you take the pan out of the oven, place it in a warm bath of water in a bigger pan. That way, it will cool down more slowly and be less likely to crack.",

When you\u2019re ready to use your whammy bar, plug your guitar into an amp, play a note, and gently push the bar down to drop the pitch of the sound. Practice playing chords and riffs with the whammy bar added. You can also pull up on the whammy to raise the pitch.",

        "answer": "To make wine glass charms, start by picking up some ring-sized memory wire from the craft store. If you have longer memory wire, use heavy-duty wire cutters to cut it to about an inch and a half. Next, use a pair of pliers to pinch the end of the wire into a small loop. Now that you\u2019ve secured one end of the wire, add beads or charms. Once you\u2019ve affixed all the decorations you want, make another loop at the other end of the wire. Finally, attach the charm to a wine glass.",

        "answer": "If you\u2019re trying to get tar out of carpet, start by blotting it with a paper towel. Then hold an ice cube against the stain for a minute. When the tar feels hard, use a butter knife or a spoon to scrape up as much as you can. To remove what\u2019s left, you can try wetting a cloth with water and dry cleaning solvent and gently dabbing the stain. If that doesn\u2019t work, try mixing a little dishwashing detergent with some water and blotting the stain. Got a really stubborn stain? You may need to try a commercial product, like WD-40.",

Before the mud dries, press a strip of paper tape into the freshly mudded joint, starting at one corner and working your way to another. Seal the tape with your trowel, let it dry overnight, then sand the first coat. Repeat this process with a thicker layer of mud for 2 additional coats.",

You can then create one of the trim's signature bands by shaving a band around its neck about a half inch to an inch above its shoulder blades. Once you\u2019ve finished shaving this neck line, make sure your poodle is securely standing still and shave a vertical line down its back from its shoulder blades to the base of its tail. Afterwards, create the waist band by shaving a horizontal line from its last rib to its underside on both the right and left sides. To finish off the trim, shave a 2 to 3-inch wide band all the way around your dog\u2019s tail.",

        "answer": "If you want to make lollipops, combine sugar, light corn syrup, and water in a small saucepan over medium heat and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Bring the mixture to a boil, then continue to cook it until it reaches the hard-crack stage, or 300 to 310 \u00b0F. Take the saucepan off the stove, then stir in your flavoring oil and gel food coloring. When the mixture stops bubbling, use a metal spoon to pour it into the molds or onto a greased baking sheet. Place the lollipops sticks halfway into the candy while it is still soft, then let the candy harden.",

        "answer": "To remove a tree stump, first use a shovel to dig up the soil around the tree so the roots are exposed. Then, cut the smaller roots up into pieces with loppers, and use a pruning or reciprocating saw to cut up the bigger roots. When you\u2019re done, use a shovel or pry bar to lift the stump out of the ground. Fill in the leftover hole with soil and loam. For a faster method, you can rent a stump grinder from a home improvement store. Place the stump grinder over the stump, then slowly grind it away until it\u2019s about 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 centimeters) below the surface. Finish by filling in the hole with loam. To get rid of a tree stump using stump removal chemicals, first cut it as close to the ground as possible. Then, drill several holes into the top of the stump that are at least 10 inches (25 centimeters) deep. Fill the holes with a stump removal chemical, then wait 4 to 6 weeks for the stump to rot. Finally, break up the rotted stump with an axe and remove it from the ground.",

        "answer": "If you want to grow vanilla but don\u2019t live in a tropical region, build a greenhouse that stays between 65 and 85\u00b0F, and maintain 85% humidity in the area. Then, fill a small pot with an orchid potting soil and make sure its pH is between 6.6 and 7.5. If it is, plant the vanilla cutting in the pot, mist it daily, and fertilize it weekly. Continue to care for the plant for 2 to7 years before it starts fruiting.",

Create Medusa\u2019s head of snakes by forming 10 to 12 small braids and weaving small rubber snakes in between the braids using elastics and pins. Alternatively, if you have short hair, you can recreate this look by purchasing a green wig and gluing rubber snakes throughout with a hot glue gun.",

Then, fold some felt fabric in half and insert a pin at the halfway point along the fold. Next, cut a piece of string that's the same length as the radius you found and tie one end to the pin and the other end to a pencil so you can draw a half circle on the fabric. After you draw the half circle, cut another piece of string that's as long as you want your skirt to be and use it to draw a second half circle. Finally, cut along the lines you drew to finish your skirt.",

        "answer": "If you want to remove yellowing from white appliances, you can clean them weekly with some basic household products. For a simple and natural solution, try sprinkling a generous amount of baking soda on a damp cloth and wiping down your appliance. Then, wipe it down again with a clean, wet cloth. You can also make your own cleaning solution by combining warm water, bleach, and baking soda in a bucket. With gloved hands, dip a clean sponge in the solution, wring it out, and clean your stained appliances. Let the solution sit for 10 minutes before wiping the appliance down again with a wet sponge. Another way to remove yellowing from your white appliances is to use an all-purpose cleaning spray with bleach. You can also try using a magic eraser pad by wetting the sponge and wiping down the appliance thoroughly.",

        "answer": "To make a pipe from a soda can, first rinse the can out with clean water and let it dry. Once the can has dried, use your thumb to make a small indentation on the side of the can. Next, punch several small holes close together in the base of the indentation with a needle, pin, or pen. Use a pen to make a larger hole somewhere else on the side of the can, which you\u2019ll cover with your thumb while you smoke. Sand the area around the indentation to remove any chemicals that may be vaporized while you smoke. When you\u2019re ready to smoke, place your material on the indentation, cover the large hole with your finger, and inhale through the mouth of the can to fill it with smoke. Release your finger when you\u2019re ready to inhale the smoke. Remember that heating aluminum to high temperatures is linked with serious health risks, so it would be safer to build a pipe out of other easily available household items, like an apple or a potato.",

Try to avoid getting any on your wheels or paint, since this can dull the paint or remove clear coat. If you\u2019re cleaning your whole car, do the wheels and tires first so you don\u2019t get mud or grime on your paint job. Leave your tire cleaner to soak for 1 or 2 minutes. Then, scrub them with your brush. Once you\u2019ve lifted the dirt from your tires, rinse them with a hose or pressure washer.

        "answer": "To make Chicken 65, start by cutting chicken into bite sized pieces, then coating them in a thick marinade. The ingredients are flexible, so you can use a mixture of cumin, turmeric, coriander, and garam masala, or get more creative, as long as you also include chili powder and a ginger-garlic paste.

        "answer": "To make beef Wellington, start by searing a center-cut beef tenderloin for 3 minutes on each side so the meat will hold its shape as it cooks in the oven. Once you\u2019ve seared the meat, make some duxelle by cooking minced shallots, mushrooms, garlic, and butter for 25 minutes in a separate pan. While the duxelle is cooling, place overlapping strips of prosciutto on a spread-out piece of plastic wrap. Spread the duxelle over the prosciutto and place the tenderloin on top. Then, lift up the ends of the plastic wrap to tightly cover the beef with the prosciutto. Chill the beef in the fridge for 15 minutes before removing the wrap and rolling the meat in puff pastry. Afterwards, wrap and chill the beef Wellington for another 15 minutes, then bake it at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 40 minutes.",

Use 2-4 fl oz for a fawn that\u2019s knee-high or 4-6 oz if it\u2019s waist-high, and give it a bottle every 3-4 hours. However, keep in mind that in most cases, you should leave a fawn alone, since its mother is likely hiding nearby. If you\u2019re sure the fawn is orphaned, call a wildlife rehabilitator, and only attempt to bottle-feed it if the rehabilitator tells you to.",

Next, fold the paper in half vertically and use your finger to crease the edge. Unfold the vertical fold, and fold the left and right edges in toward the crease you just made and continue making vertical folds. Once the paper is folded, unfold everything, rotate the paper 90\u00b0, and pinch the creases into you upward \u201cV\u201d shapes.",

Unscrew the cap, then check the dipstick to determine how much oil you need to add. Usually, the distance between the bottom of the stick and the top is equal to 1 quart of oil, so estimate based on that. Add the oil to the reservoir slowly, checking the dipstick periodically, then close the oil fill cap.",

Once you have all of the wood, build the hull of the ark and add the flooring so there's a lower, middle, and upper deck. You'll also want to add a door to the side of the ark so it's easy to board. Once you've finished the hull and flooring, build a roof to cover the upper deck. Finally, coat the hull of your ark with pitch so it's waterproof.",

Once you get the hang of it, you can experiment with different knots, like square knots and half knots.",

You should also put up sheer drapes on the window in front of your plant to filter out intense afternoon sun. To keep the light exposure even, rotate your plant by a quarter turn each week. Before watering your snake plant, wait until the soil feels dry, and sprinkle the water along the edge of the pot, rather than dumping it all in center. If you can, use distilled water so the minerals in tap water don't harm your plant.",

        "answer": "Cleaning your indoor house plants will help them stay healthy and keep pests at bay. Regularly spritz the leaves of your plants with lukewarm water to prevent a build-up of dust, which can attract insects. If the leaves are large, you can even use a damp cloth to wipe them down. You can also use a soft-bristled toothbrush to gently scrub dust off leaves if it has already built up over time. If the leaves on your plant are very small, swish them around in a bucket of lukewarm water to clean them quickly. Just make sure to support the soil in the pot with your hands so it doesn\u2019t fall out when you turn the plant upside down. Once a year, put your plants in the shower and spray them all over with lukewarm water to remove any grime that\u2019s been building up. Leave them to drip dry before returning them to their normal place.",

You can trim off some of the plant every day or once a week, which will encourage new sprigs to grow. Also, when you're harvesting rosemary, only take sprigs that are at least 8 inches long so you're not harvesting from newly growing branches. Once you've found a sprig you want to harvest, use shears or scissors to cut off the top 2 inches. Just make sure you're not harvesting more than a quarter of the plant at a time.",

        "question": "What are the best methods for getting grass stains out of clothes?",
        "answer": "To remove grass stains from clothing, try using white vinegar. First, remove any excess dirt or grass by blotting the area with a damp rag. Avoid rubbing, as this will cause the stain to penetrate deeper into your clothes. Once the dirt is removed, soak the stain in a mixture of equal parts warm water and white vinegar. After the stain has sat in the vinegar mixture for 5 minutes, apply laundry detergent to the area and gently massage the fabric for several minutes. From there, rinse the stain with cold water and repeat the process until it fades away.",

        "answer": "You can remove perfume stains from cotton or other washable fabrics with simple household ingredients. Try dabbing the stain with a damp sponge or cloth. For tougher stains, try soaking a paper towel in rubbing alcohol or a mixture of glycerin, detergent, and water. Then, cover the stain with the paper towel and leave it for 10 minutes. If that doesn\u2019t work, soak the material in equal parts water and baking soda for 15 minutes, then wash it in your washing machine. To get perfume stains out of leather or suede, wipe it with warm, soapy water. If the stain\u2019s still there, sprinkle cornmeal on top, leave it to sit for half an hour, then brush it off.",

        "answer": "To learn basic cross hatching, draw a series of parallel lines. Next, add a perpendicular series of lines over the first set of lines. If you want to create lighter shading, draw fewer lines spread further apart. Alternatively, make the lines thicker and add more layers closer together for darker shading. You can also add layers of cross hatching in different directions to create a subtle, rich shading.",

        "answer": "To insert a male catheter, start by washing your hands and the area around your penis with warm water and soap. Put lubricating jelly on the first 10 inches of the catheter and get into a seated position with your legs bent. Use your non-dominant hand to hold your penis straight out in front of your body and slowly insert the end of the catheter into the opening at the top of your penis. Push the catheter in about 7 to 10 inches or until urine starts to flow through it. As soon as you are done urinating, pinch the top of the catheter closed with your dominant hand and slowly pull it out. Keep the end facing upward so no urine spills out.",

        "answer": "Washing egg off your house probably isn\u2019t how you'd like to spend your time, but fortunately you can easily remove egg stains with household items. If you can, remove the excess egg before it dries, since this will be much easier. Wipe it away with a cloth or scrape it off with a dull knife. If you have a hose in your garden, spray the egg away with water. To get rid of any dried stains, try mixing 1 cup of non-bleach laundry detergent into a bucket of warm water. Then, scrub your wall with the water and a hard-bristled brush. Alternatively, mix 1 cup each of white vinegar and warm water in a spray bottle. Then, spray the egg stains with it and scrub them off with a sponge. For tougher stains, try using a paint scraper.",

Before you begin, cover any areas you don\u2019t want painted with tape. You\u2019ll need to sand the surfaces, apply a coat of primer, then paint your cabinets. It\u2019ll take 24 to 48 hours for each coat of your primer and paint to dry. You might need more than 1 coat of paint to achieve the color you want. After your final coat has dried, apply a layer of clear varnish to protect the paint.",

        "answer": "To build an ant farm, start by placing a lidded glass jar inside a larger one and filling in the area between them with a mixture of slightly damp dirt and sand. Next, find some ants in your yard and gather them up using a large spoon. Once you\u2019ve collected about 25 ants, put them in the large jar with the dirt. Then, put the lid on the large jar and use an awl or sharp knife to poke tiny holes in it so the ants can breathe. Finally, keep the jar covered with a black cloth while you\u2019re not watching them to encourage them to dig closer to the sides of the jar.",

        "answer": "If you want to tie dye some of your fabrics, Rit powder will give you more control over mixing colors. Start by gathering your supplies, including plastic bags, newspaper, gloves, rubber bands, a large tub, hot water, and vinegar or salt. Then, bunch up and twist your fabric and wrap rubber bands around it to hold it together and create your tie-dye pattern. Place rubber bands around the twisted fabric at intervals to separate the colors. Next, fill a 3-gallon bucket with your dye solution, which you'll want to make according to the instructions on the box. To make sure your colors are vibrant, add 1 cup of salt or vinegar to your solution. Either dip your fabric into the desired colors or submerge your entire piece into the bucket for a single color. Once you\u2019ve applied all of your colors, rinse your fabric under hot water. Then, gradually decrease the water temperature until the water runs clear.",

Snip the edge of your ribbon at a 45-degree angle or cut it in an inverted \u201cv\u201d shape, which will help with the fraying. Apply a thin layer of clear nail polish to the edges of the ribbon to help the fabric stay together. You can also apply an anti-fraying spray or clear craft glue to the tip of your ribbon to keep the threads together.",

You'll need to prepare the bottles by washing them in hot, soapy water and allowing them to dry completely. Plan to get a jig or base to hold your bottle steady so you can drill a hole in the center of the stopper. Also, you'll need to find a drill spot on the bottle, preferably somewhere on the back near the bottom. Once you drill your hole, you'll want to sand it down to avoid any sharp edges. You can then feed your string of lights into the bottle through the hole you just drilled. Then, plan to use the stopper to protect the cord from being cut by the raw glass edges of the hole.",

        "answer": "To make bhatura, start by mixing active dry yeast in warm water and allowing it to sit for 10 minutes. Next, in a large bowl, mix maida, sooji, sugar, and salt. Then, add the yeast solution, oil, and yogurt, stirring all of the ingredients together until a soft dough forms. Once everything is combined, cover the bowl and let the dough rise in a warm location for 3 to 4 hours. After the dough doubles in volume, divide it into 8 equal balls and flatten them into circles with a rolling pin. Finally, fry each bhatura in hot oil until it\u2019s golden brown.",

        "answer": "To wash tulle attached to a dress or outfit, turn the garment inside out and zip and button all of the closures. If your tulle isn't attached to an outfit, you don't need to do any prep. Next, place the tulle in a mesh laundry bag to protect the delicate fabric and place it in your washing machine. Then, add a mild detergent and wash the tulle in cold water using a gentle cycle. Finally, hang the tulle up to air-dry or tumble-dry it using low heat.",

Be careful not to add too much syrup, since maple syrup is very sugary. Next, add water and shake your container, or stir the mixture thoroughly with a spoon. If you\u2019d prefer to use seltzer, add it right before serving to keep your carbonated water from going flat. Serve immediately, or let the switchel steep for 12 to 24 hours to strengthen the flavor.",

Then, use a clean hypodermic needle to puncture a small hole in the eggshell, about 1 half-inch from the small end of the egg. Make sure not to insert the needle too far, or you could damage the embryo, and do not reuse the same needle on different eggs to ensure sterility. From here, you should inject about .5 milliliters of vegetable food coloring into the egg, just under the shell and membrane, by inserting the tip of the needle into the hole.",

        "answer": "While you may want to cut your strawberries differently depending on the occasion, always start by cleaning and hulling them. Rinse your berries under cool water and pick the green top stems off by gently twisting and pulling them. Put the tip of a paring knife into the top of the berry just outside the white center part and slide the knife around to cut out the hull, which is the most bitter part of the strawberry. For a quick snack, pie, tart, or smoothie, cut your strawberries in half vertically. If you\u2019d prefer smaller pieces for a fruit salad, then slice them in quarters. You can also cut your berries into vertical slices if you want thinner pieces for a topping on a dessert or oatmeal.",

        "question": "What are the best ways to remove soap scum from glass shower doors?",
        "answer": "If you have soap scum on your glass shower doors, you can easily clean it off with a homemade cleaner. To make your own cleaner, all you'll need to do is boil vinegar in a small pot, then mix it with an equal amount of dish soap and pour it into a spray bottle. Let the mixture sit for 30 minutes to cool, spray your shower doors with it, and wipe it away with a clean microfiber cloth. Alternatively, you can mix 1/2 cup baking soda and 1/4 cup white vinegar into a paste and rub this on your shower doors. Leave it for 15 minutes to work its magic, then wipe it off. You can also use toilet bowl cleaner instead if you have this on hand, although it's not as effective as the other cleaners.",

        "question": "What are the best ways to take care of poinsettias?",
        "answer": "To care for a poinsettia, first, choose a spot where your poinsettia can get 6 hours of indirect sunlight each day. For example, set it near a sunny window facing east or west. Try to keep the temperature around 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C), and make sure it never gets colder than 50\u00b0F (10\u00b0C) since it's leaves could fall off if it gets too cold. Poinsettias don\u2019t need a lot of water, but you should water your plant when the soil feels dry. As you water the poinsettia, stop as soon as you see water leak through the holes at the bottom to the pot. This will prevent overwatering. Poinsettias only bloom from November to March, so most people prefer to buy a new one every year for the holidays. If you\u2019d prefer to keep your poinsettia year round, fertilize it with an all-purpose fertilizer in early January.",

Continue stirring as you add the coconut flakes and marshmallows to the mixture, then fold in the grapes and canned fruit. Before serving your salad, chill it in the fridge for 1 hour. To make a yogurt-based salad instead, replace the sour cream and whipped topping with vanilla yogurt, mix in the coconut flakes and marshmallows, and add bite-sized pieces of fruit as desired.",

Once outside, they\u2019ll need 2-3 months of warm weather to grow. You\u2019ll also want to place cages in the garden or planter to help support the plant\u2019s weight. Water your tomato plant every few days to keep the soil moist, and fertilize once a week to give the plant nutrition to grow.",

        "question": "What are the steps to set up spider traps?",
        "answer": "The easiest way to trap spiders in your home is by setting up a sticky trap. All you need to do is put something sticky on top of a flat object, like some double-sided tape on a piece of card. Alternatively, you can buy ready-made sticky traps from a hardware store. Place your traps in dark places where spiders may hide, like under the utility sink or the water heater. You can also place a bottle lid filled with water next to your trap, since spiders are attracted by water. Another good place for your traps is beside baseboards, since spiders and insects like to walk along them.",

All you\u2019ll need is a bubble level and a screwdriver or wrench. Start by removing the grille at the bottom of your fridge to expose its legs or rollers. Depending on your fridge, you\u2019ll need to adjust these with a screwdriver or wrench. Generally, you\u2019ll need to turn the legs or rollers clockwise to raise them. You want your front legs to be \u00bc-inch higher than the back to help the coolant drain. Place your bubble level on top of the fridge behind the door to measure the angle.",

        "answer": "If the power isn\u2019t working for your electric car windows, you might be able to fix it yourself with a multimeter and a little electrical know-how. If all your windows have stopped working, you might just need to replace the fuse. You can locate your car\u2019s fuse box underneath or near its dash. If only one window doesn\u2019t work, check around the seal for any small objects that might be stuck inside. If you can\u2019t find anything, take off the window switch and test the wiring with a multimeter. If the wiring\u2019s fine, test the window with another switch from your car. You might need a new switch. Otherwise, you might have to replace some of the wiring. If the wiring\u2019s fine but it still doesn\u2019t work, you might have to replace your window\u2019s motor or regulator.",

You can purchase a lint roller in most supermarkets, which contain a tube of adhesive papers that you can roll over the clothes to pick up lint. If you don\u2019t have a lint roller, you can make your own by wrapping a piece of wide packaging tape around your hand and patting it on the clothes to pick up lint. If you have sections of pilling or clothing such as velvet or wool that attract lint, consider getting an electric lint shaver to remove the stubborn lint quickly and easily.",

        "answer": "To make filo pastry, start by combining flour, salt, olive oil, vinegar or lemon juice, and warm water to make the dough. Knead the dough for 15 minutes, then let it rest for 2 hours. Afterwards, cut the dough in 8 or 10 pieces, and roll them as flat as possible. Then, wrap each sheet of dough around the dowel of the rolling pin, and flatten it by rolling the pin forward on the work surface. Layer the sheets on a piece of parchment paper, and make sure to brush each one with olive oil to keep them from sticking to each other.",

If you want to harvest the roots, wait at least 7 years before carefully digging them up.",

        "answer": "To grow a chilli plant from a seed, start by sandwiching your seed between two damp paper towels in a sealable bag. Leave it in a warm room for 2-5 days until it wells or sprouts. At this point, plant it in a tray filled with a light compost or potting soil. Cover the tray with plastic wrap to lock in the heat and moisture. Once your seedling has 5-6 leaves, replant it in a pot with about a 3-inch diameter. Place the pot outside or near a window so it gets plenty of sunlight. When your chili plant grows too big for its pot, you can either replant it in a bigger pot or plant it in your garden. Either way, make sure it gets 6-8 hours of sunlight a day and give it plenty of space to grow.",

You can then sprinkle the ground flaxseed on your yogurt, cereal, or salads, or bake them into muffins, cookies, and cakes.

Once the yo-yo is fully extended, tug sharply upwards with your middle finger so the yo-yo climbs its string again.",

Next, combine cornmeal, flour, salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, and garlic powder in a bowl, and whisk some eggs in a separate bowl. Once you've done that, dip the okra pieces in the egg mixture and then the flour mixture, and add them to the skillet. Finally, fry the okra pieces in the oil for 3-6 minutes, or until they're golden brown.",

Fold the triangle in half again, then unfold it to leave a crease down the middle. With the top point facing you, fold the right corner to the bottom point of the triangle. Then, fold the left side down in the same way. Flip the paper over and fold the left corner over to the right corner to give you a diamond shape. After that, turn the paper so the longest angle of the triangle faces away from you and fold the left corner over to the right to make the wolf\u2019s tail. Fold the right side of the paper so it overlaps the tail. Finally, fold the top middle triangle down to make the wolf\u2019s nose.",

        "answer": "To make mason jar candles, start by securing the wick to the bottom of the jar with hot glue, then place 2 pencils over the mouth of the jar on either side of the wick. Next, fill a saucepan with 2 inches of water and position a candle-making pouring pot in the pan. Then, add the wax to the pouring pot and use medium heat to melt the wax evenly. Finally, let the wax cool to 130 to 140\u00b0F, fill the jar with the wax, and give it 24-48 hours to set before lighting your candle!",

First, find a bar of soap and press the bleeding nail into the soap at a 90-degree angle so it's 3-4 millimeters deep. Then, hold your dog's paw still in this position for 3-4 minutes. After a few minutes, gently twist and pull the soap off your dog's nail. If your dog's nail is still bleeding, repeat the process until you've successfully formed a plug with the soap.",

If your power washer is gas powered, make sure to wear ear protection as well. Then, fill it up with fuel. Alternatively, connect it to a grounded power source if it\u2019s an electric model. Next, connect your garden hose to the washer and a spray tip to the nozzle. Position the tip at least 2 feet away from the surface you want to clean. Point the nozzle at a 45 degree angle to the surface, which will help direct flying debris away from you. Once you\u2019re in position, pull the trigger to spray the water.

        "answer": "To grill fish, start by cutting it up into small fillets so it's easier to cook. Then, season or marinate the fillets while your grill is preheating to around 550 degrees Fahrenheit. Once the grill is hot enough, place the fillets directly on the grill grate, reduce the heat to medium, and let them cook for 3-5 minutes. Next, flip the fillets over and let them cook for 3-5 minutes on the other side. Finally, take the fillets off the grill once they're firm and opaque all the way through.",

During this time, stir constantly so it doesn't burn. After 5 minutes, add your cardamom and other spices you like, and let the milk cool on your counter or in refrigerator for 2 hours. Then, add pistachio crumbles to your molds, if you like, before pouring in your milk. Cover and freeze your Kulfi for at least 6 hours before serving.",

After you've done this for a few days, wait beside the food and see if the cat still comes to eat it. If it does, try sitting down on the ground and moving slightly closer to the food each day so the cat gets accustomed to your presence. Additionally, try engaging in a non-threatening activity, like reading or gardening. Once the cat appears comfortable being near you, hold a treat, like a cube of chicken, in your hand to see if it will eat it. When the cat eats from your hand, try reaching out with the other hand and petting it.",

Therefore, you should clean these areas for them using a damp cloth. You should also wipe its body with a damp cloth after its eaten as many kittens are messy eaters. As you wipe your kitten, move in the direction of the fur to avoid irritating it, and pay special attention to the area under the tail, which can get dirty. When you wipe its face, work from the front to the back so you don't get water in its eyes. Alternatively, if your kitten doesn\u2019t seem that dirty, use a brush to clean its coat.",

        "question": "What are the steps to put together a horse grooming kit?",
        "answer": "To assemble a horse-grooming kit, get some curry combs made out of different materials, like rubber, plastic, and metal, which you can use to brush loose hair, dirt, and dander out of your horse's coat. You should also add a soft, medium, and stiff bristle brush to your grooming kit so you have brushes for both the sensitive and tough areas on your horse's body. Additionally, you should get a wide-tooth comb and brush, which you can use to detangle your horse's mane and tail. In addition to combs and brushes, you'll want a hoof pick to clean your horse's hooves with, as well as some sponges and rags for bathing your horse.",

If you'd rather attach your shelving to the wall, position a bracket on the wall where you want the shelf to go, mark it with a pencil, and drill holes in the wall. Next, screw in the bracket at one end, then make sure the shelf will sit level by putting your board on top of the bracket and holding it in a straight line. Finally, attach the second bracket to the wall at the other end before screwing your shelf onto both brackets.",

Gently blow as if you are sighing until you can feel the air begin to fill the gum and turn it into a bubble. Remove your tongue from the gum and keep blowing as long as you can, or until the bubble bursts.",

        "answer": "If you want to give your leather couch a fresh dye job, you\u2019ll need to first clean it and remove any glaze or surface treatment. Put the couch in a well-ventilated area and wipe it down with soapy water, then rub the surface with a rag soaked in deglazer or acetone. Protect the legs and any other parts you don\u2019t want to dye with painter\u2019s tape. Once you\u2019re ready to dye the couch, spritz a small section of the leather with water. This will help the leather absorb the dye more easily. Pour 1 or 2 drops of leather dye onto a clean sponge or wool dauber, then spread the dye over the dampened section of leather using long, parallel strokes. Move from one section of the couch to another, and always spray a little water on before applying the dye. Let the couch dry for 1 hour, then repeat the process 2 to 5 times. After the last coat is dry, spray on some finisher to seal in the color and rub it in with a dry rag.",

Once your straps are properly adjusted, make 1 or 2 folds and tuck the straps under the tightening mechanism. Secure them with a rubber band or piece of twine so they won\u2019t fall back out. You can also cut the remaining material if the straps are too long and you won\u2019t have any future use for them. Just make sure to leave 2 to 4 inches for any minor adjustments. If you cut the material, melt the edges with a lighter so they won\u2019t fray or slip through the tightening mechanism.",

        "answer": "Before you grill kebobs, soak the skewers in water for 30 minutes and cut all of the ingredients into 1-inch cubes. You can also marinate the meat in vegetable oil, pepper, and spices. Then, skewer the ingredients and grill them over medium heat on a gas grill for 10-15 minutes, or 2.5 minutes each side. When you think they\u2019re done, cut into the meat to make sure it is tender and has no reddish juices.",

Look for sustainably-sourced fish that has bright, shiny skin and firm, orangish-pink flesh. Then, prepare your cure by mixing salt, sugar, pepper, and the herbs of your choice. Once you've made the cure, rinse your salmon and lay it on a piece of plastic wrap before rubbing the cure into both sides of the fish. Wrap it tightly, then place it in the refrigerator to cure for at least 3 days.",

Then, wrap a compress in a towel so it doesn't come into direct contact with your skin, which can cause further injury.

After 15 minutes, remove the compress, since keeping it on any longer can damage your skin. Once you\u2019ve waited 2 hours, apply another compress in the same way.

You can also place the nut on a hard surface and hit it with a hammer to break the shell; however, using this method may also break the nut apart. If you have a nutcracker, place a pecan between the arms of the nutcracker and gently squeeze it until you hear a crack, being careful to not crush the nut inside. Once you crack the shell, peel it away and enjoy your pecans.",

Once you\u2019ve spread them on a tray, place them in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 10-15 minutes or until they\u2019re golden brown. While they\u2019re roasting, stir the almonds with a spatula so they cook evenly. When the almonds are cooked, remove them from the oven and transfer them to another baking sheet, which will cool them down. If you want to store your roasted almonds, make sure they\u2019ve cooled down completely before sealing them in a container to prevent them going moldy from excess moisture.",

When the grill is heated, place the cobs over direct heat and cook them for 7-10 minutes, or until they are evenly charred. Make sure to turn the corn every few minutes with a pair of tongs. Next, brush the corn with butter and a coat of mayonnaise. Finally sprinkle grated cotija cheese, chopped cilantro, and chili powder on top.",
